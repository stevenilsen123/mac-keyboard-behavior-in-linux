# MacOS Keyboard Behavior in Linux

![logo.png](logo.png)

<br><br>
This [keyd script](./default.conf) seeks to deliver all the **superior** MacOS keyboard behavior you love in Linux!

This project is tested in a [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) environment, on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), which is based on [Arch](https://archlinux.org/).

## Prerequisite
1. Install [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) on your Linux machine
    * Get it from [the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) if you are runing Arch or an Arch-based distro such as Manjaro. Speaking of Manjaro, check out [How to Enable Arch User Repository (AUR) in Manjaro Linux](https://www.linuxshelltips.com/enable-arch-user-repository-manjaro-linux/) if you haven't already done so.
    * If you are running some other Linux distro:
        1. Check into your local mental health ward
        2. Follow the [installation instuctions](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd#installation) on GitHub
2. Enable keyd:

```
sudo systemctl enable keyd
```
3. Reboot

> ### **NOTE**
> The below reccomended keyboard shortcut assignments use Ctrl instead of Alt becaust the keyd script you are about to install will swap your Ctrl and Alt keys

4. Optional (but highly recommended): Install [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) and assign it to Ctrl+Space
5. Optional (but highly recommended): Install [Emote](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote) and assign it to Ctrl+Super+Space

---

## Usage
> ### **NOTE**
> As a base starting point, this script will swap your Ctrl and Alt keys in all applications. Keep this in mind if you are wondering why a particular application-specific shortcut you are used to using is not working as expected.

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) first!
2. Download this repo as a zip file to your Downloads folder

3. Unzip, move the script to the appropriate location, and clean up the mess:

```
unzip ~/Downloads/mac-keyboard-behavior-in-linux-main.zip -d ~/Downloads
sudo mv ~/Downloads/mac-keyboard-behavior-in-linux-main/mac.conf /etc/keyd/mac.conf
rm -Rf ~/Downloads/mac-keyboard-behavior-in-linux-main.zip
rm -Rf ~/Downloads/mac-keyboard-behavior-in-linux-main
```

4. Reload keyd to apply changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart keyd
```

**DONE!**
